# Crypto$

Crypto$ is an iOS application that embodies a currency ticker. It's main objective is to 
compare numerous currencies with cryptocurrencies. 


# Why? 

The time I created this app, Bitcoin value was increasing at an exponential rate. 
Everyone was talking about it... so of course I wanted to hop on the crypto wave as well. 
As I invested my time into cryptocurrency, one question I always asked myself was 
'how much is __ coin worth now?'.  

I knew I wasn't the only one with this problem as my co-workers at the time also had this concern.
As a result, I took the initiative to make a crypto ticker.
